You are working in the grit-find Rust repo (AI-aware).

Then review the last 20 github commits to get a understanding of what has changed.


Task:

    Using OpenAI to propose a GitHub search query...
Error: expected value at line 1 column 1

can you help fix this?


Hard constraints (follow exactly):

Do NOT change core domain types in crates/core/src/*.rs unless I explicitly say so.

other CLI or integration files ONLY if truly necessary.

After making changes, run cargo test and ensure all tests pass by fixing implementation issues (don’t weaken tests).

Before making any edits:

Summarize in 3–5 bullet points what you plan to change and which files you’ll touch.

Start by giving me that plan, then apply the changes.
